! Introduction

This widget shows a set of tiddlers to be on a graphical timeline.

! Content and Attributes

A list of tiddlers is specified using filter.

Each matching tiddler is shown on the timeline using it's specified start date and end date fields.  The start date defaults to the 'created' field and the end date is optional.

If present, the `color` field is used to render the corresponding item or group on the timeline.

!! Validate date format on tiddlers
* By default dates are parsed using the TiddlyWiki date parser (which will handle the 'created' and 'modified' fields)
* An override date format can be specified.
* This format will apply to both the start and end dates, and customTime.
* Additionally the start date or end date field on a tiddler, or the customTime attribute, can be set to the word "now", this will set that date in the timeline to the current date and time when the timeline is displayed.
